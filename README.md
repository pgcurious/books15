# Agentic AI Foundations & Confidence

## Phase 1: Build Strong Foundations

A comprehensive course designed to take you from understanding the fundamentals of Agentic AI to building, deploying, and optimizing your own AI agents.

---

## Course Philosophy

This course is built on three thinking frameworks:

### 🔬 First Principles Thinking
We break down complex AI concepts to their fundamental truths. Instead of accepting "this is how it's done," we ask "why does this work?" and build understanding from the ground up.

### 🔄 Analogical Thinking
Complex AI concepts become intuitive through carefully chosen analogies. An LLM is like a brilliant colleague; tools are like giving that colleague hands; memory is like giving them a notebook.

### 🌊 Emergence Thinking
Simple components combine to create surprisingly sophisticated behaviors. Just as consciousness emerges from neurons, agency emerges from the interaction of LLMs, tools, and memory.
